It is designed to bridge the long-standing gap between facilities-focused geographic information systems and traditionally non-spatial IT operational data, enabling organizations to understand, manage, and act on their assets and services within a physical, location-aware context.

Modern organizations rely on increasingly complex environments where technology, space, and people intersect. Offices, campuses, hospitals, and industrial facilities all contain thousands of interconnected assets whose value and risk are inherently tied to where they are located. While ITSM platforms excel at tracking incidents, changes, and asset lifecycles, they often lack meaningful spatial awareness. Conversely, GIS platforms provide rich spatial intelligence but are frequently disconnected from operational IT workflows. Capybara exists to unify these domains.

At its core, the Capybara Framework treats indoor space as a first-class dimension of IT operations. By aligning ArcGIS Indoors models with ITAM and ITSM data structures, Capybara enables assets, work orders, incidents, and service relationships to be visualized and analyzed in place. This spatial context improves situational awareness, accelerates troubleshooting, and supports more informed decision-making across technical and operational teams.

The framework is intentionally platform-agnostic, focusing on patterns, conventions, and integration strategies rather than prescribing a single vendor-specific solution. While examples frequently reference ArcGIS Indoors alongside common ITSM tools, the principles outlined in Capybara can be adapted to a wide range of systems and organizational environments. This flexibility allows teams to adopt the framework incrementally and tailor it to their existing technology stacks.

Capybara also emphasizes practical implementation over abstract theory. The documentation is organized to reflect the lifecycle of a real deployment, from initial planning and prerequisites through configuration, integration, utilization, and ongoing maintenance. Wherever possible, guidance is grounded in real-world scenarios, common pitfalls, and lessons learned from operational environments.

A key design goal of the framework is to support collaboration across traditionally siloed disciplines. GIS analysts, IT administrators, facilities managers, and operations staff often work with overlapping data but different tools and perspectives. Capybara provides a shared conceptual model and vocabulary that helps these groups align their efforts and understand how their systems interrelate.

Automation and repeatability are also central themes. As organizations scale their indoor spatial data and IT integrations, manual processes quickly become unsustainable. Capybara includes guidance, scripts, and patterns that support programmatic data management, validation, and synchronization, enabling teams to maintain accuracy and consistency over time.

The Capybara Framework is intended to be both instructional and extensible. Readers are encouraged to adapt its recommendations, extend its components, and contribute improvements back to their own implementations. Rather than a rigid standard, Capybara serves as a living framework that evolves alongside organizational needs and technological capabilities.

Ultimately, Capybara aims to make IT operations more visible, contextual, and actionable by grounding them in the physical environments they support. By integrating spatial intelligence into ITAM and ITSM workflows, organizations can move beyond static records and reactive processes toward a more holistic, location-aware approach to managing technology and services indoors.
